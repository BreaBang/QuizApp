## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git

I used a tutorial by Ania Kub√≥w to build the inital version of this app and then updated some of the css styling and the content.

The quiz is made up of objects inside arrays. 

## If I had more time

In the future I would optimize it by requiring and email address input to get the quiz result and sending the result in an email so that content creators or business could add to their email list and provide value content at the same time. 

## Issues

There is something wrong with how it is generating the answers. I haven't figured it out yet but the selected answer choices and the results output are different that what is supposed to be the result.
